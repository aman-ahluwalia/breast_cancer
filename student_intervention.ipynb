    "Gaussian Naive Bayes: There are many real life applications of naive bayes like to name a few, to mark an email as spam or not, a text document belongs to one or other category, image classification with naive bayes, etc. Naive Bayes is a simple and easy to implement algorithm. Due to its simplicity, this algorithm might outperform more complex models when the data set isn’t large enough. It is also pretty fast, e.g., if you have a large multi-class problem, you’d only have to train one classifier whereas you’d have to use One-vs-Rest or One-vs-One with in SVMs or logistic regression. Another point is that you don’t have to worry so much about hyperparameter optimization – if you are estimating the class priors from the training set, there are actually no hyperparameters. The Naive Bayes algorithm makes an assumption that the features used are conditionally independent. This may lead to wrong decisions in case the assumptions are not met. Here i suppose the herustics were meeting, and it is a simple case with simple categories, order and all those complex behaviours like in sentimental analysis, wont come in affect in the problem at hand. So we can give it a shot and check its outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees: Decision trees are oftenly used for determining the success of a project or marketting startegy, though complex examples also include predicting library use, Characterization of Leiomyomatous Tumors, and Star/Cosmic-Ray Classification in Hubble Space Telescope Images etc. Decision trees are simple and give direct picture of what we are trying to do, they can handle both numerical as well as categorical data, uses white box model, etc. The most important limitation of decision tree model is, it can easily create over-complex trees that do not generalize well from the training data(overfitting). Other limitations include trees do not tend to be as accurate as other approaches, trees can be very non-robust, the problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts, etc. Its kind of a simple decision making problem, that given the relevant data, to decide the output i.e. in our case is pass or fail. I feel Decision tree would be suitable candidate for this case (unless it overfits the samll amount of data), as it can predict the outcome following a decision structure formed from the fixed train data, with limited fixed column values given.\n",

    "Support vector machines: SVM's are used in Protein Fold and Remote Homology Detection.Protein remote homology detection is a central problem in computational biology. Supervised learning algorithms based on support vector machines are currently one of the most effective methods for remote homology detection. There are many other applications of SVM's like SVM for Geo- and Environmental Sciences, content based image retrieval, DATA Classification using SSVM, etc. Support vector machines tend to work very well in complicated domains where there is a clear margin of separation. But do not perform well in very large datasets because the training time happens to be cubic in the size of the data set. Also they do not work well when there is lots of noise, when the class are very overlapping you have to count the independent evidence. As in our case, it happens to be a small dataset, so the learning is feasible and it suites the properties, so we can give it a shot and check how it performs on our test set.\n",

Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "As we have limited data, and we have to choose our assumption among the provided data and constraints, lets look at each aspect of the problem. The prediction time(test) is little bit more in SVM as compared to others but the difference is not much (max just order of 10, which is bearable when we are talking in terms of milliseconds) but the thing which completely demarcates SVM from the others is its F1 score on test data. F1 score in case of Decision tree classifier(on train) is perfect, but fails in case of test, as it tends to overfit.\n",
    "But the tough competiotion lies between gaussian and SVM, as we can clearly see gaussian's F1 score in case of test, tends to rise with increase in data, and could be a better choice if we have a massive data, but as with present limited constraint of data, i would go with Support Vector Machines, plus we can tune the kernel to get better performance.**"

    "**Answer: A vanilla SVM is a type of linear separator. As here, we want to split probable students who will pass or fail by drawing a line. Notice that there are an infinite number of lines that will accomplish this task. SVMs, in particular, find the \"maximum-margin\" line - this is the line \"in the middle\". Intuitively, this works well because it allows for noise and is most tolerant to mistakes on either side. But what if we don't want a straight line but a curved one? We achieve this not by drawing curves, but by \"lifting\" the features we observe into higher dimensions. Kernel tricks allow us to draw \"straight lines\" in very high dimensions, and even infinite dimensions. Now lets have a brief about the algorithm. “Support Vector Machine” (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. Here also we try to find a boundry which separates probable students who will clear and who wont. Now whenever a new entry/student data comes in, we can run the algorithm to find the point for that student on the graph, and check on which side that lies, and we are done.**"
